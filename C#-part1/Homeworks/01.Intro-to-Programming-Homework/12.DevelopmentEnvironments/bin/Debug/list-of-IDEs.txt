Some of the most popular Integrated Development Environments (also knows as IDEs):

(1). Visual Studio Express:
	Visual Studio has an advantage when it comes to programming. This IDE is mostly used by corporate programmers to produce .NET code. 
	Sometimes people want to try the product without investing thousands of dollars first, so Microsoft has the Express editions for all of their products. 
	This makes it perfect for casual users that want to hack out some code as a hobby or programmers who need a free solution to code in C#.
	
	*Pros:
		+Intellisense
		+Automatic code formatting
		+Extensibility
		+Compiles Code
	*Cons:
		-CPU Hog
		-Overwhelming GUI
		-Cost

(2). Eclipse:
	This is the best alternative if you are not a big fan of Microsoft’s Visual Studio. The interface is a lot cleaner and concise than Visual Studio and the languages that are possible to use extend past the .Net Framework. 
	Besides being the number one way to develop Android applications via the Android SDK, it is fully extensible to use languages such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.

	*Pros:
		+Language Extensibility
		+Free
		+Compiles Code
	*Cons:
		-Steep Learning Curve

(3). NetBeans:
	This is the number one alternative to Eclipse. This program is extensible and free, and it compiles code which is a bonus. 
	When installing Netbeans it comes with a Java server called GlassFish that you could deploy on your computer for your testing environment. 
	This server is the second biggest server for Java next to WebSphere (which is a whole different ball game).

	*Pros:
		+Extensible
		+Compiles Code
		+Free
	*Cons:
		-Bloated

(4).  Aptana Studio:
	If web and scripting languages are more of your style, Aptana is well suited for the task. PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Python are supported as well as the likes of Adobe AIR. 
	Even the studio itself is available as a plugin for Eclipse if you prefer the way Aptana handles your work and want to combine it with a more comprehensive IDE. 
	Aptana Studio 3 is free and available solely under the GNU General Public License.
	
	*Pros:
		+Low hardware requirements
		+Free
		+Supports many web languages
	*Cons:
		-Not begginer friendly

(5). Xcode:
	Languages: Objective-C, Objective-C 2, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch APIs
	Price: FREE

	This IDE is just for creating iOS and Mac apps. If you're thinking along Apple-y lines and want to get into iPhone or iPad development, Xcode might be your first stop. 
	This IDE includes an iPhone simulator and GUI builder, too.

	*Pros:
		+Free
		+Graphical interface builder
		+Syntax-aware and compiler-aware source editor
	*Cons:
		-Little to none third party support / tutorials for beginners.
